        " The primary purpose of this exercise is to equip students with practical skills in financial data analysis using real-world data. By engaging with actual cryptocurrency price data, students learn how to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, performing tasks that are commonly required in finance and trading roles. This exercise not only improves their technical proficiency in using analytical tools like Python and APIs but also enhances their understanding of market dynamics and trading strategies. Through this hands-on approach, students develop a more robust comprehension of how data analysis can influence financial decision-making and strategy development, preparing them for real-world challenges in financial markets.\n",
